I am currently part of two ANR-funded (ANR: French National Resarch Agency) projects.

### Stat4Plant

*Statistics for characterizing interactions between plant and its environment*. [Link](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-20-CE45-0012)

Coordinator: Estelle Kuhn (INRAE Jouy-en-Josas).

"The Stat4Plant project aims at developing new statistical methodologies and new algorithmic tools for modeling and analyzing genotypic variability 
and interaction between plant and its environment in a context of climate change. 
The project consortium gathers scientists in modeling and applied statistics with large experience in interdisciplinary collaborations in plant sciences 
and biologists with strong expertise in phenotype-genotype relations."

### EntrainPark

*Speech impairment in Parkinson’s disease: effect of rhythm and neural entrainment*. [Link](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-21-CE28-0011)

Coordinator: Anahita Basirat (Université de Lille)

"The current project aims at exploring the relevance of rhythmic priming (i.e. listening to rhythmic auditory stimuli before speech production) to 
rehabilitate speech impairments in PD. We will address this issue by using a combination of psychological, linguistic and neuroscientific approaches and 
by investigating behavioral and electrophysiological (EEG) measures."
